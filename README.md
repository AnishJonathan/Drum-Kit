# Drum-Kit
This is a Drum kit website which I have created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The drum icons on clicking makes the respective sounds represented on the images. The Drum sounds can also be triggered by pressing the respective keys represented on the respective drum images.It uses the concept of EventListeners present in the JavaScript and Document Object Model (DOM).
